#1. process velocity

#related script : fillgap_in_velocity_vx.m fillgap_in_velocity_optic.m fill gap first 

# get_shp_fix.sh 	get the velocity boundary shape file for choosing the fluxgate 
# arrow_velocity.sh calculate the abs velocity and the angle of the velocity 
#pre_process_opt.sh  get this as reference

#get_velocity_angle.sh 	get the velocity and angle along the fluxgate
